project 3 1502 

- Only changes in the database from Assignment 2 will be a field in the users 
  table to determine regular user or an administrator, and the hashing 
  of the passwords. Add a couple of extra accounts for the regular users.
- All users of the system must log in first.  
	- keep track of both regular users and administrators in your database, 
	and distinguish between the two based on their ids.  
	- New (non-administrator) users able to register during the login process.
	Update database and go to login page.
- Administrator logs in
	- Sees the initial Open Tickets page as in Assignment 2, with the addition 
	  of the Change password option.  
		- Data shown in tickets table must now also be stored in a Javascript 
		variable (think).  All sorting options for tickets (by received, by 
		sender name, by sender email, by subject) must be done locally by client, 
		no contacting server.
	- Any options done by the administrator that require new data (ex: switching 
	  views) must be done using AJAX techniques (no refresh). 
		- within each different view the sorting options are allowed, and must be 
		done locally. 
		- Thus, with each switch of the view data downloaded from server 
		must be stored in a Javascript variable.
		- "View Selected Ticket"(and all options derived) must be implemented 
		without a refresh. Done by presenting the single ticket in a table formatted in 
		the same way that you present the entire list of tickets.  If necessary, you 
		can even completely reformat the page being viewed using DOM.
-(non-administrator) logs in, have 3 options:
	1. Submit a new ticket
	2. See all of my tickets
	3. Change password
		
- other filter methods
- view selected ticket	
- For good security, your entire site should be required to use https rather 
  than http.  This can be done in a fairly easy fashion with XAMPP, since it 
  enables HTTPS by default.  To see how to require HTTPS: ex20s.php, ex20bs.php, ex20cs.php.
- Site should use CSS and be presented in a very nicely formatted way.  
  Style points will be given.
- 2 versions of initialization script: initME.php and initSalim.php. Use your 
  email address (with the + option) for all of the email accounts in the initial 
  database, use (sem156@pitt.edu)(again with the + option) initSalim.php.  
  Otherwise, the two scripts should be identical. However, DO NOT HARDCODE any 
  email address into the software.  You should allow a new user to have any email address.
